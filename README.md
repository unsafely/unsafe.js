Unsafe JS
========

## What

Unsafe JS is a modern JavaScript application framework without any license and
patent, based on famous Vanilla JS framework, written in completely ECMAScript 5
without any fancy features. It was maintained by Project Unsafe and 
its unsafety is guaranteed.

## Why

Because all JavaScript library sucks except YUI-Compressor (it is written in Java).

## How

```
./dist.sh
```

and include `dist/unsafe.min.js` in wherever you want.

Please refer `docs/README.md` for detailed documents.
