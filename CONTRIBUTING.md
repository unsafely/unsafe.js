## Development guide

### Building system

Unsafe JS is not using any build tools except YUI Compressor, the build script in `dist.sh` is just combine all source file then compress them. A good way to start working on Unsafe JS is just create a new source file in related directory under `src`, then add it in `./dist.sh script as an `include` statement.

### Unsafe JS Modules

Unsafe JS is a modularized project and organized in different modules, either you can contribute in an existing module, or you can create your new own module.

### Unit test

It is required for contributers to write test for their code, and must be reviewed by maintainers. Unsafe JS provide a easy-use test suite under `test` folder, as well as a simple test framework.

We suggest you can use TDD (Test Driven Development) strategy to develop, but it is not required.
